CARMA Platform Release Notes
----------------------------
Pre-Release Version 3.0.0, released 15 July 2019 
----------------------------------- 

**Summary:**
CARMAPlatform pre-release version 3.0.0 is the first step to integrating Autoware and its components, specifically NDT matching and pure pursuit. CARMAPlatform now includes both lateral (steering) control and longitudinal (speed) control for full SAE level 2 autonomy. GNSS initialization of NDT matching has been added in order to localize the vehicleâ€™s position on the 3D Point Cloud Map with LiDAR scan.  A temporary UI integration has been included for minimum viable functionality while awaiting further development of CARMA guidance node. Other highlights of this release are the new drivers (e.g. Velodyne LiDAR, Novatel GPS), conforming to the new CARMA3 API, Docker updates, and adding code coverage metrics to Sonar Cloud.  
**Repository: CARMAPlatform**      
-PR 303: Add missing package to build script

-PR 283: Now that the UI is using static topics instead of going through the interface manager this PR properly remaps those topics to their actual location.  
-PR 282: Fix UI Integration node to properly fill out the set_guidance_active response based on new guidance state.  
-PR 281: Change localization configuration for points_downsample and ndt_matching.

Version 2.7.2, released 17 July 2018
------------------------------------

This is the first public release of the CARMA platform (internally known as Prototype I).

Installation must be performed from a development computer.  Once the system is built 
locally on that computer, the remote installer tool, found in the engineering_tools 
directory, can be run to transfer the executable and configuration files to the target 
vehicle computer in a directory named /opt/carma. Please see the User Guide in the docs
folder for more details.

Operating the software requires that it is installed in a properly modified vehicle, with
corresponding device drivers in place.  Use at FHWA Saxton Lab is on customized Cadillac SRX, 
Ford Escape and Freightliner Cascadia truck.
